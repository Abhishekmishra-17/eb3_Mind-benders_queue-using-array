## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Implementation of Queue using array 

### 1. Story Outline:
In this experiment user will click on "run" button to run the simulator as well as algorithm. Once the global variable declared by the simulator which is shown by animation then it will ask for array size. The array size is given by user <br>
Once the array size is inserted an array will make in animation part. User will free to choose any operation like deQueue enQueue e.t.c. whatever operation is choosing by user the working animation  of that operation will show in animation part and output will shown in console part. 
### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Describe here : (guide When a user lands up into a simulator, the visual stage is the first thing that user comes across. The visual stage should include all the elements to be seen by a user on an imaginary canvas.  (This should NOT include any drawings. ) )

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
In this experiment user will able to learn the array implementation of queue with their working animation, which is plus point of this simulator. After completion of this experiment user will be able to get the concept of Queue, enQueue, deQueue and IsFull, Is empty condition.
Task assessment questions will improve the knowledge of known concepts, which included in last of the simulator session. 
##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
