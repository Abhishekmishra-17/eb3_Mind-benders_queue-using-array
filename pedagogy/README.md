#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Problem Based
###### Assessment Method: As per handout

<u> <b>Description: </b> The instructional strategy of this experiment is "Problem based", it means that student will perform the experiment and are able to find the solution of problem statement. The problem statement is in form of input array and simulator will show that the concept of queue for that particular problem. </u>
